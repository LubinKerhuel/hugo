An overview of the model is given and a LQR feedback control loop tested.\n    -- Video of the stabilized platform with a 4 state LQR feedback loop. The platform is completely autonomous (no user input).\nThe top of the pendulum is comparable to a head where the microcontroller acts as a brain and the inertial sensor (accelerometers and rate gyro) as the inner ears. The base of the pendulum is a modified RC toys comprising two wheels driven by two independent DC motor (see pictures below).\nhardware The head and the base trolley are described successively. They are separated with an $8mm$ carbon tube. The pendulum length is $0.52m$ from wheel axis to the top. Wheels diameters is $8cm$. Pendulum total weight is $200g$ comprising $111g$ for the 4 AA batteries.\n  Inverted Pendulum   head electronics Microcontroller The controller is a Microstick II board equipped with a dsPIC 33EP128MC202 running at $\\approx 70\\ MIPS$. It is powered through the USB modified cable which provide only the power supply from 4 AA batteries hold in the base.\n  Microcontroller and sensor on top of the inverted pendulum  A prototyping board support a Microstick II board with the dsPIC 33EP128MC202. A sensor board from drotek endowing the ICM-20608 inertial sensor is screwed on the base board.   IMU sensor The unique sensor used is a 6 DoF1 IMU2 sensor: the ICM-20608 from invensense mounted on a drotek board provides:\n a 3 axis Accelerometers and a 3 axis rate gyro.  The ICM-20608 values are read through an I2C interface running at 400kHz. The I2C interface implemented through the I2C blocks for dsPIC enable hot plug of the sensor: The microcontroller sends an initialization sequence for the sensor each time this last is detected. Others sensor boards were tested endowed with MPU9250 and MPU6050 chips. The GY-91 board is currently the more commonly found on the market and has 10 DoF1.\n The accelerometer is configured with a range of $\\pm 8g$ low pass filtered at $99Hz$. The rage gyro is configured with a range of $\\pm 500 \\deg/s$ low pass filtered at $250Hz$.  The PCB board provides a $3.3V$ regulator and 4 pin extra interface ( GND, +3.3v, Tx, Rx ) to connect either a data logger, a radio link for telemetry module or an RC receiver capable of S.BUS or S.Port protocol (i.e. UART based).\nBase trolley Motors The base trolley is based on low cost a 2-wheel remote control toy. Its electronics is removed. Two pairs of wires power the two DC motors in either direction through an L298N H bridge external module.\n  FlyWheels toy package     Inside of the FlyWheels toy with its two DC motors   Power electronics The L298N H bridge controls two DC motors. For each motor:\n Two logic signals set the motor state: direction, brake, or free-wheels. One logic signal power-up the motor depending on to the state defined. This third signal is modulated with a 100Hz square periodic signal (PWM) whose duty cycle vary from 0% to 100%. It sets the torque for the motor.  The flat multicolor rubbon connects 6 logic control signal (3 for each motor) from the Microstick II dsPIC to the input of the L298N H bridge.\n  Base trolley of the inverted pendulum  A L298N H bridge (for arduino) power board drives the two DC motors of a modified FlyWheels toy. Four AA batteries powers the pendulum.   Batteries Four $1.2V$ AA NiMh batteries are dispatched on both side of the trolley. $\\approx 4.8V$ powers the motors and the electronics. The black and red wires from the trolley to the top of the pendulum powers the Microstick II electronic and sensors.\nModel The pendulum model is composed of two intertwinned sub-system:\n The 1 DoF pendulum, with 1 rotational DoF1 around the wheels axis The 1 DoF trolley, with 1 horizontal translation DoF1.  The 1 DoF pendulum is characterized by a length $L$ and a weight $M$. It is a $2^{nd}$ order system.\nThe 1 DoF trolley is characterized by the motors dynamics when translating the base loaded with an up-right pendulum. The model is $1^{st}$ order system characterized by its time constant $\\tau$.\n1 rotational DoF pendulum bla bla bla\n1 translational DoF trolley Controller Stabilization overview: The microcontroller computes the angle of the pendulum from the inertial sensor measurements (accelerometers and rate gyro). A feedback loop stabilize the pendulum up right while maintaining the pendulum position still. The pendulum translation is estimated through an internal dynamic model of the trolley stimulated with a copy of the DC motor command. The pendulum slow translations reflect the drift of the internal estimation of the displacement.\nVideo of the inverted Pendulum when it encounters a wall:     --\n Degree of Freedom ^ Inertial Measurement Unit ^   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547937328,"objectID":"c13377e7fa82e136ee7818015f8986c8","permalink":"https://lubin.kerhuel.eu/docs/invertedpendulum/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/docs/invertedpendulum/","section":"docs","summary":"Presentation  Objective is to build an unstable pendulum platform to experiment various control loop to stabilize it.\n    Top of the inverted pendulum   The DIY hardware is presented.
