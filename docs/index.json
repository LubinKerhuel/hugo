You also need a receiver, a remote control, battery packs and few optional hardware for data recorder, and telemetry.  It can be an exciting platform for testing various control theory.\nDifference with existing auto-pilot Off the shelf autopilot exists and might works great (Ardupilot, PX4, iNav, LibrePilot, Paparazzi, further autopilot projects are listed on the DroneTrest review). Their parameters can be tuned. However testing your own controller on such autopilot requires implementing it at the right place, thus understanding the code structure underneath. Even well documented, it represents hundreds of C functions to understand, before possibly starting any changes. Your custom control loop might not fit the existing structure provided controller implemented in such projects are typically PIDs and you might want to implement a more complex structure, using different sample rate.\nThe presented autopilot use a Model Based Design (MDB) approach: The autopilot code is generated from a single simulink model. This is also named Rapic Control Prototyping (RCP).\nThe autopilot controller use standard math blocks and the system low level parts is taken care with the Microchip blockset to drive the microcontroller peripherals and the UxV blockset to easily add features like GPS parser, Remote Control S.BUS, F.Port and Smart Port protocol, Mavlink messaging including Way Point and Parameters protocols. The simulink model allows to \u0026ldquo;get-in\u0026rdquo; graphically. It allows simulating parts of the system based on a simulated plane or based on values logged from a real flight which is very useful to work on sensor fusions algorithms.\nAnother key difference is the use of a 16 bit microcontroller while other autopilot use 32 bit microcontroller. 16 bits dsPIC prove to provide all required ressources thanks to the efficient architecture underneath which handle the many peripheral used in an efficient way (UART, I2C, Output Capture, Input Compare\u0026hellip;).\nA similar model based design also using dsPIC microcontroller is developed by Pr E.Elkaim at UCSC in a project named SLUG. Their design is independent from the one presented here. SLUG and SLUG II projects rely on the same tool used here to target the dsPIC: the blockset for Microchip microcontrollers (free).\nHardware list Various combination of material were tested. Below is a selected list of hardware which prove to be efficient.\n RC platform: Volantex Firstar 1600 with stock motors and servos (Alternative platform are Bixler 2 and Ranger 1600) Remote Control: FrSky QX7 Receiver: FrSky XSR-M / XSR used with either the S.Bus (receiver channel output) and S.port (Telemetry) protocol or with the F.Port protocol which combine both both S.bus with S.port saving one UART peripheral of the microcontroller. Each protocol use only one wire thus half duplex UART. dsPIC UART peripheral enable configuring Tx and Rx on one line.\n Microcontroller: dsPIC 33EP on a AUAV V2 board. External motion sensor are used instead of built-in AUAV sensors. Tiny sensor board with recent chip are easier to firmly attach near the CG reducing vibrations. A custom board based on a dsPIC might replace the AUAV board which is difficult to find now. The UDB5 mini is similar and can still be found. IMU sensor: Gy-91 (10 DoF with 3 accelerometers, 3 rate gyro, 3 magnetometers and one barometer). Firmly attached near the CG of the plane. I2C bus is used between sensors and mcu. Pitot tube:  An inner tube and an outer tube on which four hole are done laterally. Signal conditioning: the pitot tube pressure sensor (MPXV 7004 DP) is done with a MCHP ADC converter which integrate an analog amplifier. Converted pressure is sent to the microcontroller through the I2C bus.  GPS: based on a $\\mu$blox M8N chip providing up to 10Hz refresh rate and provided good results compared to competitors chips. Data logger: openlager board to log on SD card. It allows logging continuous UART output flow with at a baud up to 2 470 000 (much higher than a 115 200 baud rate that OpenLog data logger cannot sustain.). Radio link: 3DR Sik based Radio module for mavlink telemetry (plane attitude, position, Way Point and Parameters tuning) with qgroundcontrol base station running on most platforms (PC, android, windows, linux). Action cam: RunCam2 to film the plane and its surface control from the top; getting a visual behavior of the autopilot in the action.  Results Sliding mode based controller tested in both pitch and roll axis with two mode:\n Control plane angular rate control (angular speed set-point given through the remote control) Control plane angle attitude (angle set point provided through the remote control)  Average CPU load was 7 to 8% on a dsPIC 33EP running at 70 MIPS. It includes the IMU estimation algorithm, autopilot control loop and all low tasks (handle various protocols (I2C, NMEA for GPS, F.Port, Mavlink and log sensors data at 1Khz through an UART configured at 24700000)\nTested with strong wind. Showing fairly good robustness despite the low number of parameters tuned so far (video link on top).\nPitot tube air-speed estimation validated using GPS speed measurement as reference.\nValidated the wind speed and direction estimation based on a difference between the GPS and pitot tube speed measurement taking into account the plane orientation.\nValidated automatic calibration of the magnetometers axis offset and gain. Once in the air, the magnetic perturbation near the floor are negligible. An algorithm automatically determine if the calibration can be refined using current data (using standard flight input data, no looping or specific roll required).\nNext steps Reduce chattering on ailerons when sliding mode control is enabled.\nTest in flight mavlink protocol parameters tuning.\nAdd automatic guidance of the plane, using Mavlink Way point sets.\nSite content Time constraints does not allow writing a complete description of the project as originally planned. Part of projects which I find interesting and inspiring will be posted.\nIdeas to expand:\n IMU Pitot tube Wind estimate UxV blocks including GPS, Remote Control and Mavlink blocks and functionalities Magnetometers auto calibration  ","date":1558216800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558825831,"objectID":"04e0d53a7e70716ebb790ffe0137ed2b","permalink":"https://lubin.kerhuel.eu/project/autopilot-plane/","publishdate":"2019-05-19T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/autopilot-plane/","section":"project","summary":"Model based design for an RC plane autopilot","tags":["simulink","matlab","rapid prototyping","model based design (MDB)","dsPIC","Sliding Mode","autopilot","UAV","mavlink","FrSky","UxV blockset","AUAV V2 board"],"title":"Auto-pilote for Plane based on Simulink","type":"project"},{"authors":["Lubin Kerhuel"],"categories":["Electronics"],"content":"The board PDB-XPW from MATEK System is a voltage regulator with an current measurement adapted for quad copters current with a max current measurement of 140 Amps.

Objective is to build a low-cost DIY1 platform to test various feedback control loop.\nThis document describes the hardware and the theoretical model of the pendulum. Simulation are presented with Simulink models and an LQR2 feedback control loop finally stabilizes the platform.\n    -- Video of the stabilized platform with a 4 state LQR feedback loop. The platform is completely autonomous (no user input).\nThe electronic placed at the top of the pendulum composed of a dsPIC 16 bits microcontroller and an inertial sensor (accelerometers and rate gyro). The base of the pendulum is a modified RC toys comprising two wheels driven by two independent DC motor (see pictures below).\nHardware Overview The head and the base trolley are described successively. They are separated with an $8mm$ carbon tube. The pendulum length is $0.52m$ from wheel axis to the top. Wheels diameters is $8cm$. Pendulum total weight is $200g$ comprising $111g$ for the 4 AA batteries.\n\r\r\rInverted Pendulum platform\n\r\r\rHead electronics Microcontroller The controller is a Microstick II board equipped with a dsPIC 33EP128MC202 running at $70\\ MIPS$. It is powered through the USB connector which only provide the power supply from 4 AA batteries hold in the base.\n\r\rMicrocontroller and sensor on top of the inverted pendulum\rA prototyping board support a Microstick II board with the dsPIC 33EP128MC202. A board from Drotek endowing the Invensense ICM-20608 inertial sensor is screwed on the base board.\n\r\r\rIMU sensor The unique sensor used is the 6 DoF3 Invensense ICM-20608 mounted on a Drotek sensor board. It endows:\n a 3 axis Accelerometers and a 3 axis rate gyros.  The I2C blocks set the BUS clock at $400kHz$ and fetch the 6 sensors values every $1ms$ $(1kHz)$. The Simulink I2C blocks setting enable hot plug of the I2C sensor: The microcontroller initializes the sensor each time it is newly detected on the I2C bus.\n The accelerometer is configured with a range of $\\pm 8g$ low pass filtered at $99Hz$. The rage gyro is configured with a range of $\\pm 500 \\deg/s$ low pass filtered at $250Hz$.  A Simulink IMU4 sub-system run a data fusion algorithm to reconstruct a drift-free quaternion angular position at $1kHz$ (the yaw angle drift when magnetometer is not present). The stabilization control loop uses the drift-free pitch angle.\nIt is possible to use other sensors like the MPU9250 or MPU6050 with either an I2C or SPI interface. The GY-91 board is a 10 DoF3 widespread board based on the 9 DoF MPU9250 (3 accelerometers, 3 magnetometers, 3 rate gyros) and has a pressure sensor.\nUART interface The PCB board provides a $3.3V$ regulator and 4 pin extra interface ( GND, +3.3v, Tx, Rx ) to connect either an UART data-logger or radio link for telemetry module or an RC receiver capable of S.BUS, S.Port or P.Port protocol (all UART based).\nBase trolley Motors The base trolley is a low cost a 2-wheel remote control toy named flywheels. The toy is from 2012 but 2 wheeled equivalents exist. Its electronics is removed. Two pairs of wires power two DC motors in either direction through an L298N H bridge board module.\n\r\rFlyWheels toy package\rFlyWheels toy package\n\r\r\r\r\rTwo DC motors\rTwo DC motors\n\r\r\r\rPower electronics The L298N H bridge controls two DC motors. For each motor:\n Two logic signals set the 4 states: direction CW or CCW, brake, or freewheel. The third logic signal power the motor depending on to the state defined.  The third signal is modulated with a 100Hz square periodic signal whose duty cycle vary from 0% to 100% (PWM). It sets the torque for the motor.\nThe flat multicolour ribbon connects 6 logic control signals (3 for each motor) from the Microstick II dsPIC output to the of the L298N H bridge.\n\r\rBase trolley of the inverted pendulum\rA L298N H bridge (for Arduino) power board drives the two DC motors of a modified FlyWheels toy. Four AA batteries powers the pendulum.\n\r\r\rBatteries Four $1.2V$ AA Ni-Mh batteries are dispatched on both side of the trolley. $\\approx 4.8V$ powers the motors and the electronics. The black and red wire from the trolley to the top of the pendulum powers the Microstick II electronic and sensors.\nPendulum Model The pendulum model is composed of two intertwined sub-system:\n The pendulum*, with 1 rotation DoF3 $\\theta$ angle around the wheel\u0026rsquo;s axis The trolley*, with 1 translation DoF3 $x$ position.  \r\rPendulum free body diagram\r$\\vec{P}$ is the weight at the center of gravity. $\\vec{R}$ is the reaction force from the stiff rod and the floor. $\\vec{F}$ is a friction force when the pendulum is rotating. $\\{ \\vec{i},\\vec{j} \\}$ is the earth frame and $\\{ \\vec{r},\\vec{n} \\}$ is the rotating pendulum frame. The inertial sensors are placed on top of the pendulum and measure all accelerations.\n\r\r\rEquations The Dynamic fundamental law applied on the pendulum: $$ \\sum \\vec{Force} = m.\\vec{a} $$\nThe three forces presents are the weight $\\vec{P}$, the Friction $\\vec{F}$, and the Reaction $\\vec{R}$ from the rod \u0026amp; floor:\n$$ \\underbrace{ -mg\\vec{j} }_{\\vec{P}} \\ - \\ \\underbrace{ k \\frac{\\partial \\vec{r}}{\\partial t} }_{\\vec{F}} \\ + \\ \\underbrace{ ( mg\\vec{j} . \\vec{r} + \\underbrace{Ctfg}_{\\text{Centrifugal}} } _{\\vec{R} } ) . \\vec{r} = ml \\frac{\\partial^2\\vec{ r }}{\\partial t^2} $$\nWith $ \\{ \\vec{i},\\vec{j} \\} $ the static earth frame and $ \\{ \\vec{r},\\vec{n} \\} $ the pendulum frame (rod and normal direction). $m$ is the mass of the pendulum (without the trolley). $l$ is the length from the inter-wheel\u0026rsquo;s axis to the center of mass of the pendulum (without the trolley)\n$$ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\vec{i} \u0026amp; = \u0026amp; \\vec{n} . cos(\\theta) - \\vec{r} . sin(\\theta) \\\\\n\\vec{j} \u0026amp; = \u0026amp; \\vec{n} . sin(\\theta) + \\vec{r} . cos(\\theta) \\end{array} \\right. $$\n$$\\vec{j}.\\vec{r} = cos(\\theta)$$\nConsidering the rotation $\\theta$, the first and second time derivative of $\\vec{r}$ are:\n$$ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\frac{\\partial \\vec{r}}{\\partial t} \u0026amp; = \u0026amp; - \\dot{\\theta} \\vec{n} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2\\vec{ r }}{\\partial t^2} \u0026amp; = \u0026amp; - \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t} \\left( \\dot{\\theta} \\vec{n} \\right) \\\\\n\u0026amp; = \u0026amp; - \\ddot{\\theta} \\vec{n} - \\dot{\\theta}^2 \\vec{r} \\end{array} $$\nThe projection of the forces equation in the pendulum frame $ \\{ \\vec{r},\\vec{n} \\} $ is: $$ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\left( ml\\dot{\\theta}^2 + Ctfg \\right) \\vec{r} = \\vec{0} \\\\\n\\left( l \\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{k}{m}\\dot{\\theta} - g . sin(\\theta) \\right) \\vec{n} = \\vec{0}\n\\end{array} \\right. $$\nThe first equation for the $\\vec{r}$ axis shows internal forces which cancel each other: the weight $\\vec{P} = -mg\\vec{j}$ which is compensated on the $\\vec{r}$ axis by the term $mg\\vec{j}.\\vec{r}$ from the reaction force which will also compensate for the Centrifugal force $ml\\dot{\\theta}^2$.\nThe second differential equation on the $\\vec{n}$ axis allows to solve for the evolution of the angle $\\theta$. It can be made linear with $sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$ when the pendulum is up near $0$, or with $sin(\\theta) \\approx - (\\theta - \\pi)$ when the pendulum is down near $\\pi$.\n\r\rPendulum model for rod rotation\rnon-linear model of the $\\theta$ angle evolution derived from the forces projected on the normal $\\vec{n}$ axis of the rod. The trolley linear acceleration input is added.\n\r\r\rThe linear approximation for $\\theta$ in the laplace domain is a $2^{nd}$ order system: $$ \\theta(s) \\left ( \\frac{1}{w_n^2}s^2 + \\frac{2 \\zeta}{w_n}s \\pm 1 \\right ) = 0 $$\nThe pendulum transfer function $F_p = \\frac{\\theta(s)}{E(s)}$ with a null input $E(s) = 1$ $$ F_p(s) = \\frac{1}{ \\frac{1}{w_n^2}s^2 + \\frac{2 \\zeta}{w_n}s \\pm 1 } $$\n The linear term for $sin$ is positive when the pendulum is up when $\\theta \\approx 0$ (unstable), and negative when pendulum is down when $\\theta \\approx \\pm \\pi$ (stable).   This transfer function is characterized when the pendulum is down by its natural frequency $w_n = \\sqrt{ \\frac{g}{l} } $, and a damping factor $\\zeta$.\nIdentification The parameter $l$ could be estimated from the platform mechanical but the damping parameter $\\zeta$ (or frictions coefficient $k$) could not be estimated easily from the platform.\nThe simulation model is satisfactory when the calculation it performs make realistic prediction. Experimental measurement is a good method to refine a model and tune its parameters. In our case, the parameters $l$ and $\\zeta$ (or $k$) are identified from the experiment explained below.\nExperimental logs The pendulum is placed on a track (two chairs back to back) so as to be able to make a complete rotation. Motor are off and the pendulum is released up-side with in the unstable condition ($\\theta = -18°$ , $\\dot \\theta = 0$).\nIt oscillates until the damping friction ($\\zeta$) stops the free oscillations.\nThe $1kHz$ sampled rate gyro and accelerometers values are recorded onboard an openlager board connected on the dsPIC UART interface.\nSimulation from logs The measured inertial sensors are then re-used as data source in a Simulink model. $\\theta$ angle is reconstructed using an IMU complementary filter algorithm implemented in the quaternion angle representation.\nThe pendulum model is initialized with the experimentation initial condition ($\\theta = -18°$ , $\\dot \\theta = 0$). Trolley linear acceleration input is null. Parameters $l$ and $k$ are iteratively tuned until the model $\\hat{\\theta}$ angle fit with the measured oscillation $\\theta$.\n\r\rIdentification - experimental $\\theta$ angle reconstructed from inertial sensors (wide grey curve) vs pendulum model (read and blue dashed curves)\r$\\theta$ angle from free oscillation experiment is compared against two pendulum models. The pendulum is released at time $16.7s$ up side ($18°$) and let free to oscillate. The grey curve is the experimental angle reference reconstructed from inertial sensors measurements. The blue dashed curve is a pendulum model using a linear damping with $k = 0.4$. The red doted curve use a non linear damping with the non linear term -1.1*$sign(\\dot{\\theta})$ added to the linear damping with $k = 0.17$.\n\r\r\r   Pendulum Parameters Identified Value     $l$ $0.45 m$   $k$ $0.4$   $w_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{l}}$ $4.67\\ rad.s^{-1}$ ( $0.74 Hz$ or $1.35s$ period )    ⬆ Identified pendulum parameters\nValidation and IMU improvement Parameters $l$ and $k$ can be further validated using the force equation and the estimated pendulum angle $\\theta$.\nThe IMU input measurements is composed of the rate gyro and the accelerometers data. Magnetometers is not used in this pendulum example. The IMU input also require the predicted acceleration vector (resp magnetometer is used). The IMU output the sensor orientation and provides the gravity vector prediction as seen in the sensor estimated attitude (i.e. quaternion angle).\nComparing the gravity vector predicted with the accelerometers measurement do not match because the sensor measures both the gravity plus the dynamic acceleration induced by the pendulum movements.\nConsidering the pendulum principal movement rotation $\\theta$, the equations of forces applied on the pendulum derive from $\\hat \\theta$ a prediction for the dynamic acceleration. The good match between the predicted acceleration and the experimental measurement confirm somehow the correctness of parameters $l$ and $k$ involved in theses calculations.\nThe updated acceleration comprising both a static and dynamic part is fed into the IMU algorithm improving the IMU correction of the rate gyro integration drift even when the pendulum is not static.\nTrolley Model Equations  🚦 Below is under construction 🚧   The translational movement of the trolley is modeled as a $1^{st}$ order system characterized by its time constant $\\tau$. This dynamic includes the motor dynamics when it is loaded with the trolley considering the pendulum as vertical.\nThe model considers as negligible the effect of the pendulum forces (translational and rotational) applied on the trolley.\n$$ x(s) = \\frac{1}{\\tau s + 1} $$\nIdentification    Trolley Parameter Estimated Value     $\\tau$ $0.3s$    The trolley does not have any sensors. No encoder or current sensor are used to control the two motors. The parameters $\\tau$ is \u0026ldquo;guessed\u0026rdquo; in a first step. In a second step, a $2^{nd}$ inertial sensor board is temporary glued in the middle of the wheel diameter to as the inertial sensor is in the wheel rotation axe. An identification can be computed from the motor set-point and the wheel movements while the pendulum was actively controlled up by a first feedback loop.\nStill the pendulum model including the trolley is simulated with its feedback loop controller and results are compared against recorded data of the real system running the same feedback loop controller. The simulated pendulum states are re-initialized periodically ($\\approx 2s$) with the real pendulum states as the model would diverge otherwise due to perturbations not modeled and model discrepancies. Correctness of the model can be checked between theses periodic re-initialization.\nController Stabilization overview: The microcontroller computes the angle of the pendulum from the inertial sensor measurements (accelerometers and rate gyro). A feedback loop stabilizes the pendulum up right while maintaining the pendulum position still. The pendulum translation is estimated through an internal dynamic model of the trolley stimulated with a copy of the DC motor command. The pendulum slow translations reflect the drift of the internal estimation of the displacement.\nLinearized model LQR feedback controller Video of the inverted Pendulum when it encounters a wall:     --\nAnother way to stabilize a pendulum with an electric see-saw (video).\n Do It Yourself\r^ Linear Quadratic Regulator\r^ Degree of Freedom\r^ Inertial Measurement Unit\r^   ","date":1536444000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558778766,"objectID":"b0ae7d29be8baee87b074905e65b1536","permalink":"https://lubin.kerhuel.eu/docs/inverted-pendulum/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/docs/inverted-pendulum/","section":"docs","summary":"LQR stabilization of an inverted pendulum platform based on a low cost toy.
