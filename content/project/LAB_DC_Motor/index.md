Control a 24V DC motor using the MCLV V2 board with a dsPIC 33EP256MC506. 
This hands-on is for 5th year students at INSA-Lyon. 

The hands-on Lab subject available at: https://rtdc.ctrl-elec.fr/.

Slides presents the adaptation required to go from a Simulink model for Simulation (or DSPACE) to a Simulink model targeting a microcontrollers. Two topics are presented:

- Real-time scheduler / CPU load analysis
- Fixed-point datatypes
