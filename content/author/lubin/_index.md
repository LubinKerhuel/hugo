I'm a signal processing and control theory Ph.D with a strong engineering background in embedded system.

Enthusiastic about applied mathematics, I realized projects on control theory from school years (1999-2005). However, the programming developpment absorbed *most of the effort* therefore projects ended up with simplest PID algorithm tuned by successive trials. The dedicated time spent on model, identification and control law was almost null.

I developed a blockset to deploy Simulink models on dsPIC Micro-Controllers Unit (MCU) in 2005 which improved the situation.

This model based designed was a game changer to complete a [PhD thesis](http://www.kerhuel.eu/publi/Kerhuel_2009_PhD.pdf) on robots inspired from the fly's visual control system (Biorobotics). It reduces the time from the simulation or dSPACE test bench platform to our autonomous [OSCAR II](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-OSCAR-II-like-its-predecessor-OSCAR-I-is-a-tethered-aerial-robot-that-orients-its_fig11_261957721) robot. 

Thereafter I joined [MOVEA](https://www.ideas-laboratory.com/projects/movea/), a spin-up of the CEA-Leti research center where I designed various data fusion algorithm for sports applications experimenting the same rapid control prototyping approach in industrial context. 

I'm now part of the team developing the [Microchip blockset](https://www.microchip.com/simulinkblocks/) for dsPIC and PIC32 microcontrollers at [Microchip Technology Inc](https://www.microchip.com/). 

For company, scientists, and students' projects, *the model-based design allows focusing on the high-level algorithm* rather than consuming time on low level programming. It allows quick validation and improvement of algorithms through onboard tests and reduces time to market improvement.

The present website shares experience of Rapid Control Prototyping tools through simple but fun projects. All are based on the [Microchip blockset](https://www.microchip.com/simulinkblocks/) (available for free, requires matlab/Simulink with embedded coder) and a board endowed with a dsPIC or PIC32.

Complementary information might be found on my publications listed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=61SJU_sAAAAJ/). Theses work were achieved using a model-based design approach.
