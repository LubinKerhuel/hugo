A KOMBI bike electrified with the TSDZ2 mid drive motor. 
The motor firmware is upgraded with the [TSDZ2 Flexible OpenSource firmware](https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TSDZ2_wiki/wiki) initiated by Casainho.

700km so far with original bike chainring and original motor blue gear and clutch. Typically, empty or loaded with two kids; three in rare occasions.
