# About me

I'm a signal processing and control scientist with a strong engineering background in embedded system.

Enthousiasted by applied math, I realized projects on control theory from school years (1999-2005). Each time, my project ends-up with a simple PID algorithm tuned by successive trials as **most of the effort** was absorbed by low level programming. I hardly get time for modelisation, identification, and simulation of feedback control loop based on more advanced algorithm.

I developped a blockset to deploy Simulink models on dsPIC Micro-Controllers Unit (MCU) in 2005 to overcome that pitfall.

From 2005 to 2009, I was lucky enough to use this model based design methodology to complete my [PhD thesis](http://www.kerhuel.eu/publi/Kerhuel_2009_PhD.pdf) on bio-robotics: robots inspired from the fly's visual control system. The rapid prototyping reduced the time from the simulation or dSPACE test bench platform to our auronomous [OSCAR II](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-OSCAR-II-like-its-predecessor-OSCAR-I-is-a-tethered-aerial-robot-that-orients-its_fig11_261957721) robot. I joined [MOVEA](https://www.ideas-laboratory.com/projects/movea/), a spin-up of the CEA-Leti research center where I validated, still using rapid prototyping method, various data fusion algorithm for Inertial Measurement Unit using low cost MEMS sensors for sports applications. 

I'm now responsible at [Microchip Technology Inc](https://www.microchip.com/) for the [Microchip blockset](https://www.microchip.com/simulinkblocks/) for dsPIC and PIC32 microcontrollers. 

For scientists, company, and students' projects, *the model-based design allows focusing on the high level algorithm* rather than consuming time on low level programming. It allows quick validation and improvement of algorithms through on site tests for better results and time to market improvement.

The present website share my experiences of Rapid Control Prototyping tools through simple but fun projects. All are based on the [Microchip blockset](https://www.microchip.com/simulinkblocks/) (available for free, but matlab/simulink is not!) and a board endowed with a dsPIC or PIC32.

Complementary information might be found on my publications listed at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=61SJU_sAAAAJ/). Theses work were mostly realised using model based design.
