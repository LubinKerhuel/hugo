# About me

I am responsible at [Microchip Technology Inc](https://www.microchip.com/) for the [Rapid Control Prototyping tool](https://www.microchip.com/simulinkblocks/) for dsPIC and PIC32 microcontrollers. 

Embedded-system and applied-math enthousiast, I realized personal projects on control theory. In such project, **most of the effort** is taken away by low level programming. Remaining time for modelisation and feedback loop simulation is reduced and projects often ends-up with a PID algorithm tuned by successive trials.

In 2004, I designed a blockset to deploy Simulink models on dsPIC Micro-Controllers Unit (MCU). The model base design saves the low-level programming task and allows to concentrate on the high level signal processing. 

From 2005 to 2009, I applied this rapid prototyping scheme to complete my [PhD thesis](http://www.kerhuel.eu/publi/Kerhuel_2009_PhD.pdf) on Biologically inspired robotics (fly's visual system from 2005-2009) where it reduced the time to convert a Simulink/dSPACE algorithm to our [OSCAR II](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-OSCAR-II-like-its-predecessor-OSCAR-I-is-a-tethered-aerial-robot-that-orients-its_fig11_261957721) autonomous robot.

In 2010, I joined [MOVEA](https://www.ideas-laboratory.com/projects/movea/), a spin-up of the CEA-Leti where I tested various data fusion algorithm for Inertial Measurement Unit to use in sport applications. 

For scientists, company, or students' projects, *the model-based design allows focusing on high level algorithm* where added value is. It allows quick validation of various algorithms and it reduces the Time to Market: from simulation to final products.

The present website present projects and information's related to Rapid Control Prototyping tools. All are based on the [Microchip blockset](https://www.microchip.com/simulinkblocks/) (provided for free) and a board equipped with a dsPIC or PIC32.

Most of my publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=61SJU_sAAAAJ/). Theses work were mostly designed using model based design scheme.
