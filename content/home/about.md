# About me

I am responsible at [Microchip Technology Inc](https://www.microchip.com/) for the [Rapid Control Prototyping tool](https://www.microchip.com/simulinkblocks/) for dsPIC and PIC32 microcontrollers. 

Embedded-system and applied-math enthousiast, I realized many projects on signal processing and control theory. In such project, **90% of the effort** (my estimate) is taken by low level programming tasks and hardware design. Time for simulation is reduced and projects often ends-up with a simple PID algorithm tuned by successive trials.

In 2004, I designed a blockset to deploy Simulink models on dsPIC Micro-Controllers Unit (MCU). The model base design saves the low-level programming task and allows to concentrate on control algorithms. 

From 2005 to 2009, I applied this rapid prototyping scheme to complete my [PhD thesis](http://www.kerhuel.eu/publi/Kerhuel_2009_PhD.pdf) on Biologically inspired robotics (fly's visual system from 2005-2009) where it reduced the time to convert a Simulink/dSPACE algorithm to our [OSCAR II](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-OSCAR-II-like-its-predecessor-OSCAR-I-is-a-tethered-aerial-robot-that-orients-its_fig11_261957721) autonomous robot.

In 2010, I joined [MOVEA](https://www.ideas-laboratory.com/projects/movea/), a spin-up from CEA-Leti where I designed and implemented Data fusion algorithm for Inertial Measurement Unit for sport applications. The use of model base design reduced the Time to Market: from experimental simulated algorithms to final products.

For scientists, company, or students' projects, *the model-based design allows focusing on high level algorithm* where added value is.

These pages present customs projects and information's related to Rapid Control Prototyping tools. All are based on the [Microchip blockset](https://www.microchip.com/simulinkblocks/) (provided for free) and a board equipped with a dsPIC or PIC32.

Few articles and patents are listed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=61SJU_sAAAAJ/).
